Final project from internshala while learning the course "programming in python"
Fantasy Cricket
It is an online game where you create a virtual team of real cricket players and score points
depending on how your chosen players perform in real life matches. To win a tournament,
you must try and get the maximum points and the No. 1 rank amongst other participants.
